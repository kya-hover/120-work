# Week 10
## Weekly Questions

This week, I learned about:
 * functions

I completed the homework assignment by:
1. reading the weekly content on the [website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-10/overview/)
2. choosing an old sketch and modifying it using functions and arrays

I did not have any major problems with this week's assignment. I did try using an array to draw an ellipse, but the ellipse I wanted to draw just disappeared. I still do not know why this happened, as there were no errors that showed up on my console.

I'm still working on figuring out one of the questions in the class issue repo, so I'll answer if I can think of a possible solution.
