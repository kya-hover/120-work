# Week 11
## Weekly Questions

This week, I learned about:
 * Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
 * classes
 * methods

I completed the OOP assignment by:
1. reading and watching the weekly content on the [website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-11/overview/)
2. studying the live code examples on the [website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-11/overview/) and thinking of different ways that they could be used

Surprisingly enough, I didn't encounter any big issues while coding for this week's assignment. I had some trouble figuring out how to get the bubbles to move away from the center in the way I wanted, but eventually I figured it out. I did not have to post any issues on the class repo issue tracker (yay!!!).

There are still no new issues are up yet, but I'll continue checking!
