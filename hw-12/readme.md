# Week 12
## Weekly Questions

This week, I learned about:
 * how to organize by using multiple JS files
 * how to make objects "interact" with each other

I completed the interacting objects assignment by:
1. reading the weekly content on the [website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-12/overview/)
2. looking at the live code examples on the [website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-12/overview/)


I had some trouble getting my bubbles to delete when they touched each other this week. I was able to make them bounce off of each other fine, but something odd would always happen when I tried splicing them! I posted an issue to the class repo and received some useful feedback from some classmates. My code now works partially, but I haven't had enough time to figure out how to fix it all the way, so my sketch is a little broken. :(

So far I'm the only one who has posted anything to the class repo, so nothing new to help out with for me.
