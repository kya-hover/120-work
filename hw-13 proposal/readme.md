# Final Project Proposal

Proposal:
For my final project, I want to create a self generating maze that is aesthetically pleasing to watch and can integrate different elements depending on the maze's background environment. I'm considering adding in environmental elements such as snowfall and rain to make things a little more interesting.

Inspirations:
While looking for ways to create different types of mazes, I ran across Shiffman's generative maze tutorials, which gave me the ideas for the type of maze I want to create.

Problems / New Things to Learn:
For this final project, I will need to learn how to set images as canvas backgrounds. I've also never made a self generating maze before, so I'm hoping to learn how as I go. I know that if I decide to add in natural elements such as snowfall, there will be some mathematical problems that I'll have to work through. Considering that I'm fairly new to coding, I'm expecting quite a few more troubles and difficulties to pop up as I go.

Work Plan:
Wk 1 (21-28) - I plan on solidifying my idea by the end of this week and getting a good starting foundation to build the rest of my code upon.
Wk 2 (29-5) - Work on getting the maze to work properly and getting the different backgrounds in place. Start and finish environmental elements if decide I decide they would go well with the maze and I have enough time to add more to my project.
Wk 3 (6-8) - Make last minute touch-ups to the code; correcting any formatting issues and optimizing readability. Submit and turn in all work.

Current Wk Progress:
So far this week, I have some of the basic parts of my maze code in place. It took me forever to come up with an idea for my project, so I don't have too much of the code written yet. I can see that this will be a challenging project for me, so I'll see how it goes!
