["Hello World!" Sketch](https://kya-hover.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

# Week 3
## Weekly Questions

This week, I learned:
* what p5.js was and how it could be used and applied
* how to create "Hello World!" sketches and more about how they work
* how to create a canvas, draw an ellipse, color the background, and insert text
* what comments were and how they to use them
* the `setup()` and `draw()` functions, how to declare them, and their parameters
* how to setup a [live webpage](https://kya-hover.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

To complete the assignment, I:
1. created a `course-work/week-3/` directory
2. Installed the "open-in-browsers" package for Atom
3. Edited and messed around with the sketch.js file and viewed it on Safari through the index.html file
4. Created a canvas in the `setup()` function using the `createCanvas()` function/command and also colored it using `background('colorname')`
5. Used the comments to state my intent for the code sketch and declared the `draw()` function and then added the "Hello World!" text along with a background color
6. Committed and pushed my changes to GitHub
7. Used GitHub Pages to create a new live website for my course repo

I did not have any problems this week with anything. Everything was fairly straightforward and made sense to me! There were also no new issue posts on the forum, so I have not helped any fellow students out quite yet.

Overall, I enjoyed this week's lessons. Although they were pretty basic, they made me curious about the different types of art that can be made through coding!
