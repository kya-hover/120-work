# Week 4
## Weekly Questions

This week, I learned:
 * how to draw the rest of the 2D shapes
 * color them using the different color selections such as RGB, Grayscale, and Hex
 * use the alpha value
 * `translate()`
 * `rotate()`
 * `scale()`
 * create sandboxes using `push()` and `pop()`

I completed the portrait assignment by:
1. reading the weekly content on the [website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-4/drawing/)
2. playing with the live code examples on the [website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-4/drawing/)
3. watching the provided videos and links in the [website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-4/drawing/)
4. sketching out my portrait on graph paper with the correct dimensions
5. planning out which shapes to make first in my sketch.js file

I had a couple of problems while coding my sketch. I could not get a gray triangle to show up in my **[index.html](file:///Users/kyahover/Desktop/120-work/hw-4/index.html)** file. It took me forever to figure out why that was happening...it turned out that I spelled triangle wrong. I also read the assignment regarding this weekly readme.md wrong, so I made an issue on the class repo and one of my classmates helped clear it up. :)

I'm still working on the helping other classmates thing...I still feel like I am the one who is normally confused. I hope to get more confident further along in this course!
