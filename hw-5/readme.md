# Week 5
## Weekly Questions

This week, I learned about:
 * loops
 * frame rates
 * variables in p5
 * making and using my own variables using `let` and `var`
 * making my code more readable
 * simple math

I completed the animation assignment by:
1. reading the weekly content on the [website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-5/overview/)
2. playing with the live code examples on the [website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-5/overview/)
3. sketching out my character on graph paper, although I did not worry about getting the exact dimensions right this time
4. planning out which parts of my code to write first

This week I had more problems than usual because I could not figure out why my index.html file wasn't showing up on my browser, so I was essentially writing my code blind for a while. I had to go to the lab and they helped me figure out that I didn't copy over the p5_lib from the empty_example directory! I also made the mistake of making my canvas dimensions using my `windowWidth` and `windowHeight`. I discovered later on that when the window size changed all the parts of my character were strewn about and distorted. I had to go back and make changes to where everything was located. I also couldn't figure out how to get my character to go exactly where my cursor was...it kept a constant distance away from the cursor. I never had enough time to figure out how to fix this.

I learned that most of my problems that seem so complicated and difficult at the time end up being painfully simple and obvious. I need to stop overthinking everything!

There were only two issues up in the issue forum this week, one being my own and the other was already resolved, so I wasn't able to assist anyone this week.
