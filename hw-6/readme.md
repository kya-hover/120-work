# Week 6
## Weekly Questions

This week, I learned about:
 * the console.log()
 * the `map()` function
 * random number generators
 * more on strings
 * how to make JavaScript objects

I completed the algorithmic sketch assignment by:
1. reading the weekly content on the [website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-6/overview/)
2. playing a lot with the live code examples on the [website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-6/overview/)
3. trying to plan how to create my algorithmic sketch using the comments in my code

This week was much more difficult for me...I'm still not a huge fan of math. I also had a little bit of trouble trying to come up with a sketch and trying to control random things. I had to base a portion of my code off of our homework example for this week because I wanted to create a similar effect, so I hope that that's alright! I made multiple drafts of this sketch, but those ones just got messy and crowded too fast. I posted and issue to our class repo this week about changing the frame rate of a certain part of my sketch and I received some useful feedback. :)

One of the only new issues this week was also posted by me, so I couldn't really help anyone this week. I'll still be on the lookout for new issues though!
