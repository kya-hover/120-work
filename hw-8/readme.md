# Week 6
## Weekly Questions

This week, I learned about:
 * loops
 * *for* loops
 * *while* loops

I completed the loop assignment by:
1. reading the weekly content on the [website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-8/overview/)
2. playing with the numbers in the live code examples on the [website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-8/overview/) to see the effect of each line of code

I didn't have too many problems or issues this week. Just a couple small things in my code that were fairly easy to work out, so I didn't have to post anything to our class repo issue tracker. I thought that the loops that we learned about this week made sense and are pretty useful!

No new issues are up yet, so I'll keep checking it to see if I can help anyone!
